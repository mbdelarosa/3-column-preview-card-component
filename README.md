## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM naming convention

### What I learned

Learnings from this challenge:
- Getting used to writing BEM class names
- Using the `align-self: start` property to stop the flex item from taking up the whole available width
	- Used on the SVG images and the Learn More buttons
- Adding an `aria-label` on the anchor tags to describe the purpose of the Learn More links (from the [WCAG 2.2 Techniques](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/aria/ARIA8))

### Useful resources

- ["How to Prevent Image Stretching With Flexbox" on TechStacker](https://techstacker.com/how-to-prevent-image-stretching-with-flexbox/) - This helped explain the default behavior of Flexbox on images (or any flex item) and provided a simple solution to modify this to prevent unwanted stretch
